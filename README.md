# Shop-react

As I delve into learning Django, React, and Docker,
I am following an older Udemy course available at https://www.udemy.com/course/react-django-admin,
which is about three years old. Consequently, significant modifications are necessary for the code.

This project will involve the creation of multiple containers using Docker Compose to host a Django web application, S MySQL database, and a Vue frontend. The rest_framework will also be utilized, and Docker's secrets will be used to set environment variables. Given that the code is outdated, substantial changes are needed to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of the technologies being used.
